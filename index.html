                <br>Throughout my career I have worked as a Business Analyst in companies that operate on the SaaS model.<br>During this time I have gained experience in different Software Development Life Cycles methodologies.<br>I assisted in training co-workers on client and non-client facing roles, along with onsite training and the implementation<br> of different projects. I helped clients like Gartner, ARM, and IBM in executing their conferences successfully.<br>
I love work which involves interacting with people and the thought process that goes into negotiating between stakeholders.<br>Ultimately I like coming up with solutions which meet the needs of business and the clients. </figcaption>
